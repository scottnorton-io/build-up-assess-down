## Phase 2: Beta Cohort Recruitment (Week 2-4)

### Priority: High | Owner: You | Status: Strategy Defined

**Objective:** Recruit 20-30 practitioners for private beta (Q1 2026)

### Target Segments

**Segment 1: Existing clients** (10-15 participants)

- Organizations you've supported in PCI assessments or advisory
- Pain points already known
- High trust, low friction

**Segment 2: QSA/ISA community** (5-10 participants)

- Known contacts from PCI SSC events
- Early adopters who see assessment friction
- Influencers in the ecosystem

**Segment 3: Security leaders** (5-10 participants)

- CISO/security directors from prior engagements
- Organizations with scope/data discovery pain
- Executive buy-in potential

### Recruitment Approach

**2.1 Outreach message template** (draft)

Subject: *Private beta: New PCI DSS training framework (Build Up / Assess Down)*

Body:

> I've developed a dependency-based PCI DSS enablement framework that explains why assessments often discover architecture last—and how to design environments where compliance emits naturally.
> 

> 
> 

> It's called **Build Up / Assess Down**, and it reconciles the Council's Prioritized Approach with how systems are actually designed (Req 1→12) and validated (Req 12→1).
> 

> 
> 

> I'm running a private beta cohort in Q1 2026 (90-minute workshop + practitioner tools). Free for beta participants in exchange for feedback.
> 

> 
> 

> Three failure modes we address:
> 

> 1. "We did Milestone 1" (but data still in logs/backups)
> 

> 2. "Segmentation is a diagram" (but not validated)
> 

> 3. "Policies before reality" (docs don't match operation)
> 

> 
> 

> Interested? Reply and I'll send details.
> 

**2.2 Outreach execution** (Week 2-4)

- [ ]  Compile list of 40-50 target contacts
- [ ]  Personalize message for each segment
- [ ]  Send 10-15 per week (avoid spam perception)
- [ ]  Track responses in simple spreadsheet
- [ ]  Confirm 20-30 participants by end of Week 4

**2.3 Beta logistics setup** (Week 3-4)

- [ ]  Schedule 2-3 workshop dates (Feb-Mar 2026)
- [ ]  Select virtual platform (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- [ ]  Prepare digital handouts (master diagram PDF, field kit)
- [ ]  Create feedback form (post-workshop survey)

**Deliverable:** 20-30 confirmed beta participants with scheduled workshop dates

**Timeline:** Recruitment complete by end of Week 4, workshops in Feb-Mar 2026

---

## Phase 3: Conference Proposal Submissions (Week 3-6)

### Priority: Medium | Owner: You | Status: Ready to Draft

**Objective:** Submit proposals for Q2/Q3 2026 conferences

### Target Conferences

**Tier 1: PCI Community Meetings** (highest priority)

- Regional or global PCI SSC events
- Direct access to target audience (QSAs, merchants, service providers)
- Submission deadlines: typically 3-6 months before event

**Tier 2: Major security conferences**

- RSA Conference (Q2)
- Gartner Security & Risk Summit (Q2/Q3)
- ISC2 Security Congress (Q3)

**Tier 3: Regional events**

- ISSA chapters (multiple cities)
- Local security meetups
- Webinar series (SANS, BrightTalk)

### Proposal Template

**3.1 Draft conference proposal** (45-minute session)

Title: *Build Up, Assess Down: Why PCI DSS Feels Backwards (and How to Fix It)*

Abstract:

> Most organizations experience PCI assessments backwards: scope surprises happen late, data discovery exposes gaps, and evidence becomes archaeology. This session reframes PCI DSS as a dependency stack and teaches practitioners to design systems where compliance emits naturally.
> 

> 
> 

> Attendees will learn:
> 

> - How PCI DSS requirements depend on each other (Build Up: Req 1→12)
> 

> - How assessments actually work (Assess Down: Req 12→1)
> 

> - How to use the Council's Prioritized Approach as a risk overlay (not implementation sequence)
> 

> - Three failure modes that break PCI programs—and how to prevent them
> 

> 
> 

> This framework is Council-compatible, outcomes-focused, and aligns with PCI DSS v4.x emphasis on intentional design. Attendees leave with practical tools: dependency maps, evidence storyboards, and advisor question banks.
> 

> 
> 

> Target audience: Security leaders, PCI program owners, QSAs/ISAs, architects, GRC teams.
>

## Risk Management

**Risk: Low beta enrollment**

- Mitigation: Start outreach early (Week 2), offer free participation, leverage existing relationships

**Risk: Master diagram production delay**

- Mitigation: Use 15-step guide, allocate focused 6-hour block, consider hiring designer if needed

**Risk: Conference proposal rejections**

- Mitigation: Submit to multiple venues, offer both keynote and workshop formats, leverage beta testimonials

**Risk: Certification portal complexity**

- Mitigation: Start with no-code MVP, upgrade later based on demand
